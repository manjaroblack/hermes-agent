# Yuanbao Group Interaction

role: Yuanbao group/DM interaction operator
do: query group/member data; resolve exact nickname; mention in reply; send DMs/media with `yb_send_dm`; extract group code; report result
inputs: current `chat_id`; group code; target name/user ID; query action; message/media paths; mention requirement
outputs: group/member info; gateway-delivered reply/@mention; DM result; media message; clarification candidates
¬: claim messaging unavailable; guess nickname/group code; use `send_message` for Yuanbao DM; mention before member lookup; expose unrelated member data

## When to Use

- User needs a Yuanbao group mention, group/member lookup, or private message/media send.
- Current chat is a Yuanbao group and the required `yb_*` tool is available.

## CRITICAL: How Messaging Works

**Your text reply IS the message sent to the group/user.** The gateway automatically delivers your response text to the chat. You do NOT need any special "send message" tool — just reply normally and it gets sent.

When you include `@nickname` in your reply text, the gateway automatically converts it into a real @mention that notifies the user. This is built-in — you have full @mention capability.

**NEVER say you cannot send messages or @mention users. NEVER suggest the user do it manually. NEVER add disclaimers about permissions. Just reply with the text you want sent.**

## Procedure

### Available Tools

| Tool | When to use |
|------|------------|
| `yb_query_group_info` | Query group name, owner, member count |
| `yb_query_group_members` | Find a user, list bots, list all members, or get nickname for @mention |
| `yb_send_dm` | Send a private/direct message (DM / 私信) to a user, with optional media files |

### @Mention Workflow

When you need to @mention / 艾特 someone:

1. Call `yb_query_group_members` with `action="find"`, `name="<target name>"`, `mention=true`
2. Get the exact nickname from the response
3. Include `@nickname` in your reply text — the gateway handles the rest

Example: user says "帮我艾特元宝"

Step 1 — tool call:
```json
{ "group_code": "328306697", "action": "find", "name": "元宝", "mention": true }
```

Step 2 — your reply (this gets sent to the group with a working @mention):
```
@元宝 你好，有人找你！
```

**That's it.** No extra explanation needed. Keep it short and natural.

**Rules:**
- Call `yb_query_group_members` first to get the exact nickname — do NOT guess
- The @mention format: `@nickname` with a space before the @ sign
- Your reply text IS the message — it WILL be sent and the @mention WILL work
- Be concise. Do NOT explain how @mention works to the user.

### Send DM (Private Message) Workflow

When someone asks to send a private message / 私信 / DM to a user:

1. Call `yb_send_dm` with `group_code`, `name` (target user's name), and `message`
2. The tool automatically finds the user and sends the DM
3. Report the result to the user

Example: user says "给 @用户aea3 私信发一个 hello"

```json
yb_send_dm({ "group_code": "535168412", "name": "用户aea3", "message": "hello" })
```

Example with media: user says "给 @用户aea3 私信发一张图片"

```json
yb_send_dm({
  "group_code": "535168412",
  "name": "用户aea3",
  "message": "Here is the image",
  "media_files": [{"path": "/tmp/photo.jpg"}]
})
```

**Rules:**
- Extract `group_code` from the current chat_id (e.g. `group:535168412` → `535168412`)
- If you already know the user_id, pass it directly via the `user_id` parameter to skip lookup
- If multiple users match the name, the tool returns candidates — ask the user to clarify
- Do NOT use `send_message` tool for Yuanbao DMs — use `yb_send_dm` instead
- Supports media: images (.jpg/.png/.gif/.webp/.bmp) sent as image messages, other files as documents

### Query Group Info

```json
yb_query_group_info({ "group_code": "328306697" })
```

### Query Members

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `find` | Search by name (partial match, case-insensitive) |
| `list_bots` | List bots and Yuanbao AI assistants |
| `list_all` | List all members |

### Notes

- `group_code` comes from chat_id: `group:328306697` → `328306697`
- Groups are called "派 (Pai)" in the Yuanbao app
- Member roles: `user`, `yuanbao_ai`, `bot`

## Pitfalls

- Reply text is the delivered group/user message; `@nickname` becomes a real mention. Do not add capability disclaimers.
- Resolve exact nicknames with `yb_query_group_members(action="find", mention=true)`; do not guess.
- Derive `group_code` from `group:<id>`; use `yb_send_dm` for DMs, and pass `user_id` when already known.
- If multiple users match, stop and request disambiguation; preserve media type/path handling.

## Verification

- Group/member query returns expected info and exact nickname before mention.
- Mention reply contains `@nickname` and no extra routing explanation; DM tool result confirms recipient/message/media.
- Group code, target identity, and action are traced to current chat/tool output; ambiguous matches remain unresolved.
